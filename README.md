# React Native FlatList rendering issue after successful API data fetch

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using FlatList in React Native to render data fetched from an API.  The app successfully fetches the data, but the FlatList component remains empty.

## Problem
The `DataFetch.js` component fetches data from a public API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos).  Although the API call is successful and the data is properly received, the FlatList component doesn't display the items.

## Solution
The solution, provided in `DataFetchSolution.js`, addresses this by ensuring the data is correctly structured and handled within the FlatList component.  This often involves double-checking data structures and handling potential edge cases.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to run the app.
4. Observe the empty FlatList after the loading indicator disappears.
